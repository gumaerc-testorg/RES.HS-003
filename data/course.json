The stakes are high\u2014students who pass the class are guaranteed a job in an MIT research lab.\u00a0\n\nOpenCourseWare documented the experience of 14 students who took this course in January 2012. Follow their journey over 11 episodes and watch as they struggled with, but ultimately mastered, the techniques needed to be successful in an MIT chemistry lab.\n\n**WARNING NOTICE**\n\nThe experiments described in these materials are potentially hazardous.
